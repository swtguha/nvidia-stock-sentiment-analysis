            "NVIDIA Will Crash So one thing that most people agree on is that Nvidia is the one benefitting from this Gold Rush ( AI Boom) being the most dominant player selling shovels ( GPU's).\n",
            "\n",
            "But my thesis is that this AI Boom isn't sustainable for long since it is not only expensive to afford the infrastructure for machine learning( data centres etc) but also time consuming to train the machines with a googol of information.\n",
            "\n",
            " Now, the problem is that currently there aren't meaningful profitable applications for these AI, especially generative AI which all the companies seem to be hopping on now just for the sake of it. It would make sense if they used this AI to enhance their products which many are but offerring generative AI as a service directly to the consumers still seems to be somewhat precarious. Most common people don't care about AI. The problem that most people are callous about is the over dependence of NVIDIA on this Generative AI Boom to the point where more than 60% of their revenue comes from the data centre/AI segment. \n",
            "Once the AI Boom fizzles out in the future (which I think is still far away), their revenue will take a hit severely and you'll just get a bunch of analysts at wall street filled with gloom just because the revenue doesn't match their expectations. As a result, the stock would take a hit. \n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, NVIDIA might still be incredibly profitable after that and bring in significant revenue especially through their leadership in the gaming segment. However it will lose its former glory and it's stock price would come crashing down. It needs to diversify soon and keep it as its top priority. \n",

            "Edit : The title may be a bit misleading, my apologies. I'm not saying NVIDIA as a company would crash, but its stock price will be severely affected once the AI Boom fizzles out and its revenue reduces , Although I don't think it'll happen in the near future. \n",
            "Am I crazy for having 57% of my portfolio in NVIDIA?  As the title says, I have more than half in one stock. I know there are rules to investing, but I don't see a downside or any headwinds soon. So far I'm up quite a bit and keep buying more as it creeps higher. At 57%, I wonder if the risk is worth it?\n",

Nvidia reported its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line on the strength of its data center business.

You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.\n",

They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.\n",

As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period.

Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom.

They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs).

Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison.

Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.\n",

            "**What is Machine Learning?**\n",
            "\n",
            "At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.\n",
            "\n",
            "As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!\n",
            "\n",
            "However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.\n",
            "\n",
            "So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.\n",
            "\n",
            "What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!\n",

            "\n",
            "Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.\n",

            "\n",
            "Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.\n",
            "\n",
            "NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.\n",
            "\n",
            "And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.\n",

            "We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.\n",

            "It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:\n",

            "The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.\n",

Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.\n",

            "\"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\n",
            "\n",
            "The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.\n",
            "\n",
            "“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”\"\n",

There's also the issue of the company's production of its' superchip at the later part of the year, which there's been rumblings that it will send the stock even higher and nullify the loss a before-split purchaser suffers.

            "Post: Nvidia- Don't Mistake a Highly Cyclical stock for Perpetual Growth. Perspective from a Software Engineer, why I set a $250 price target. Nvidia is currently trading at over 100x earnings, but many investors will justify this by claiming that \"forward earnings\" is 25x. \"Forward earnings\" is just an estimate from analysts where they took past growth, and extrapolated it out into the future. \n",
            "\n",
            "These analysts do not understand the industry. They ignored AI for several years while CUDA was regularly being used in AI research and AI projects, setting price targets and earning estimates too low, and it only caught their attention as a growth engine when AI models started producing impressive media, rather than just boring scientific papers. Now, having seen earnings, they are assuming this growth will continue perpetually, without considering how the industry works.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nvidia's growth in earnings is due to the surge in companies looking to fund AI projects. As a hot new trend, Even non-tech companies are trying to explore ways they can utilize AI, even in areas where it makes no sense and doesn't add any value. AI has essentially became a buzzword in the way that Blockchain was a few years ago, or \"internet\" was 25 years ago. Historically, these trends often last a couple years before slowing down considerably.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since AI chips are a brand new market, companies are essentially building up AI infrastructure from nothing. And Nvidia is the only real supplier. Unlike other capital goods, there is no used/secondhand market yet. So in the short term, this has understandably meant exploding earnings as Nvidia can charge outrageous prices and faces no competition.\n",
            "\n",
            "But will it last? It probably will in the short term, Nvidia can't ship enough chips yet to meet demand, and competitors will take time to produce viable alternatives, so there is probably a sales backlog that can keep them going a few quarters, possibly another year or two. But eventually supply will catch up to demand, and when that happens, growth will stagnate.\n",
            "\n",
            "On top of this, a couple years down the line most companies will abandon their AI projects that don't work out.  When they do, you now have all of this used AI hardware(or cloud capacity) that is now on the market. Other companies can then buy this hardware at a discount, or cloud services now have less of a need to expand their AI compute capacity. This is exactly what happened with the crypto mining boom- Nvidia made a huge windfall from crypto mining sales, but then the market dried up, a huge oversupply hit the secondary market, and Nvidia's earnings stagnated until AI came to the rescue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now of course, you could argue that Nvidia will release better hardware every 2 years, and that will ensure they still have a market. And I think they will. \n",
            "\n",
            "But this introduces our next problem- suppliers. Nvidia is dependent on TSMC to produce their AI chips.  They could potentially use Samsung or Intel as well. They do not own their own fab.  Fortunately for them, they already had a lot of capacity they reserved with TSMC for their RTX 4000 GPUs, which they switched to produce AI chips, which has allowed them to produce a lot of AI chips for dirt cheap, and enjoy huge margins. But when Nvidia's contract with them runs out, they're at risk. Nvidia's 75% gross margin is well known. Additionally, it's almost certain that other companies like AMD are planning their own AI products. This explosion in manufacturing demand, combined with knowledge of Nvidia's high margins, will give TSMC leverage to raise their prices, threatening Nvidia's margins.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our next issue is competitors. Nvidia may control nearly the entire  AI hardware market now, but is extremely unlikely to remain that way. AMD GPUs are just as capable of creating and running AI models as Nvidia, the main problem is most software is built for CUDA, which runs on Nvidia hardware.  \n",
            "\n",
            "With the huge surge in the AI market, it's almost certain that there are companies out there developing AI models that can run on AMD, and it's very likely AMD is designing their own dedicated AI chips and software around it. There is tremendous amounts of money to be made in producing either cheaper hardware, or software that can run on cheaper hardware. If you look on LinkedIn, job boards, etc, you'll see semiconductor companies have hired and hiring large amounts of ML/AI engineers. And these listings don't mention CUDA. Assuming that Nvidia will never face any competition is naïve. Nvidia will probably remain a leader since they are ahead, but cheaper alternatives will threaten their pricing power.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the semiconductor industry is often a boom/bust industry, and I expect it will stay that way, even with AI. Investors should be careful buying during a boom period based on the assumption that it will continue booming.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of this leads us to the valuation. Nvidia's quarterly earnings are likely to remain around $5 per share over the next few quarters, or possibly even grow a bit further, as demand remains high. But as competitors enter the market, a secondhand market emerges from failed startups, suppliers raise prices, and investor funding for AI startups dries up, I expect these earnings to decline over the next decade, until stabilizing when the industry matures\n",
